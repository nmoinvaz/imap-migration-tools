"""
IMAP Email Backup Script

Backs up emails from an IMAP account to a local directory.
Stores each email as a separate .eml file (RFC 5322 format) which is compatible with
most email clients (Thunderbird, Apple Mail, Outlook, etc.).

Features:
- Incremental Backup: Skips messages that have already been downloaded (checks existing UIDs locally).
- Filename Sanitization: Saves files as "{UID}_{Subject}.eml" with unsafe characters removed.
- Folder Replication: Recreates the IMAP folder structure locally.
- Parallel Processing: Uses multithreading for fast downloads.
- Gmail Labels Preservation: Creates a manifest mapping Message-IDs to Gmail labels for restoration.

Configuration:
  SRC_IMAP_HOST, SRC_IMAP_USERNAME, SRC_IMAP_PASSWORD: Source credentials.
  BACKUP_LOCAL_PATH: Destination local directory.

Usage:
  python3 backup_imap_emails.py --dest-path "./my_backup"

Gmail Labels:
  python3 backup_imap_emails.py --dest-path "./my_backup" --preserve-labels "[Gmail]/All Mail"
  This backs up all emails from [Gmail]/All Mail and creates a labels_manifest.json
  file that maps each email's Message-ID to its Gmail labels for later restoration.
